1. What is Static and Dynamic Inventory ?

Dynamic inventory and inventory are related concepts, but they are not exactly the same.

Inventory: Inventory, in the context of IT infrastructure management, refers to a list of hosts or devices managed by a system. This list typically includes information such as hostnames, IP addresses, and other attributes necessary for managing these devices. Traditionally, inventory lists were manually created and maintained by administrators in static files.

Dynamic Inventory: Dynamic inventory, on the other hand, is a type of inventory that is automatically generated and updated in real-time. Instead of being manually maintained, dynamic inventory is generated by scripts, plugins, or modules that query the infrastructure environment to determine the current state of the hosts. This could involve querying cloud providers, virtualization platforms, databases, or other sources of truth about the infrastructure.

Static Inventory: In a static inventory setup, you would typically have a file, say hosts.ini, where you manually list all the hosts you want Ansible to manage. Here's an example of a static inventory file:

```ini
[web_servers]
server1.example.com
server2.example.com

[db_servers]
db1.example.com
db2.example.com
```

In this static inventory file, server1.example.com, server2.example.com, db1.example.com, and db2.example.com are the hosts categorized into groups web_servers and db_servers.

Whenever there's a change in your infrastructure, such as adding a new server or removing an existing one, you'd have to manually update this file.

Dynamic Inventory: With dynamic inventory, Ansible can fetch the list of hosts automatically from various sources. Ansible provides built-in dynamic inventory scripts for popular cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform, among others. Additionally, you can create custom dynamic inventory scripts to pull information from your own infrastructure sources.

For example, Ansible includes a dynamic inventory script for AWS (ec2.py), which queries the AWS API to fetch information about EC2 instances. To use it, you would first configure the AWS credentials, and then you can use it like this:

```bash
ansible -i /path/to/ansible/contrib/inventory/ec2.py web_servers -m ping
```

This command tells Ansible to use the ec2.py script as the inventory source (-i flag), and it targets the group web_servers to run the ping module against all instances in that group.

When you run Ansible commands using dynamic inventory, Ansible fetches the current list of hosts from the specified source (in this case, AWS), ensuring that your inventory is always up-to-date without manual intervention.

So, in summary, static inventory requires manual maintenance of the inventory file, while dynamic inventory automatically fetches the list of hosts from external sources, making it more adaptable to changes in the infrastructure.
